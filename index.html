    <h3 id="one">All the Small Things - Blink 182</h3>
    <p> <br>All the small things
        True care, truth brings
        I'll take one lift
        Your ride, best trip
        Always I know
        You'll be at my show
        Watching, waiting
        Commiserating
        Say it ain't so
        I will not go
        Turn the lights off
        Carry me home
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na</br>
        <br>Late night come home
        Work sucks, I know
        She left me roses by the stairs
        Surprises let me know she cares
        Say it ain't so
        I will not go
        Turn the lights off
        Carry me home
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
        Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na</br>
        <br>Say it ain't so
        I will not go
        Turn the lights off
        Carry me home
        Keep your lips still
        I'll be your thrill
        The night will go on
        My little windmill
        Say it ain't so
        (Na-na, na-na) I will not go
        (Na-na, na-na, na-na) Turn the lights off
        (Na-na, na-na) Carry me home
        Keep your lips still
        (Na-na, na-na) I'll be your thrill
        (Na-na, na-na, na-na) The night will go on, the night will go on
        (Na-na, na-na) My little windmill</br></p>
    <h3 id="two">What's my age again? - Blink 182</h3>
    <p><br>I took her out, it was a Friday night
          I wore cologne to get the feeling right
          We started making out and she took off my pants
          But then I turned on the TV
          And that's about the time she walked away from me
          Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
          And are still more amused by TV shows
          What the hell is ADD?
          My friends say I should act my age
          What's my age again?
          What's my age again?</br>
        <br>Then later on, on the drive home
          I called her mom from a payphone
          I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
          The state looks down on sodomy
          And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
          Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
          And are still more amused by prank phone calls
          What the hell is call ID?
          My friends say I should act my age
          What's my age again?
          What's my age again?</br>
          <br>And that's about the time she walked away from me
          Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
          And you still act like you're in freshman year
          What the hell is wrong with me?
          My friends say I should act my age
          What's my age again?
          That's about the time she broke up with me
          No one should take themselves so seriously
          With many years ahead to fall in line
          Why would you wish that on me?
          I never wanna act my age
          What's my age again?
          What's my age again?
          What's my age again?</br></p>

    <p><br>I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          You could cut ties with all the lies
          That you've been living in
          And if you do not want to see me again
          I would understand
          I would understand
          The angry boy
          A bit too insane
          Icing over a secret pain
          You know you don't belong
          You're the first to fight
          You're way too loud
          You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
          I know something's wrong
          Well, everyone I know has got a reason
          To say
          Put the past away</br>
          <br>Wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          You could cut ties with all the lies
          That you've been living in
          And if you do not want to see me again
          I would understand
          I would understand
          And well, he's on the table
          And he's gone to code
          And I do not think anyone knows
          What they are doing here
          And your friends have left you
          You've been dismissed
          I never thought it would come to this
          And I
          I want you to know
          Everyone's got to face down the demons
          Maybe today
          We can put the past away</br>
          <br>I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          You could cut ties with all the lies
          That you've been living in
          And if you do not want to see me again
          I would understand
          I would understand
          I would understand
          I would understand
          I would understand
          Understand</br>
          <br>Can you put the past away?
          I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          I would understand
          I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          I would understand
          I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          And I would understand
          I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          I would understand
          I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
          And I would understand</br><p>
    <h3 id="four">Graduate - Third eye blind</h3>
    <p><br>Can I Graduate,
          Can I look into the faces that I meet,
          Can I get my punk-ass off the street,
          I've been living on for so long,
          Can I Graduate,
          To the bastard talking down to me,
          Your whipping boy calamity,
          Cross your fingers, I'm going to knock it all down,
          Can I Graduate,</br>
          <br>Echo fading, We can't let go,
          She goes walking by in slow mo',
          Sell your Heart out for a buck,
          Go on, Fade out, Before I get stuck.
          Talking to somebody like you,
          Do you live the days you go through,
          Will this song live on long after we do,
          Can I Graduate.</br>
          <br>Can I look into the faces that I meet,
          Can 1 get my punk-ass off the street.
          Won't die on the vine I want to knock it all down,
          Can I Graduate,
          Echo fading, Candle blow,
          Did you flash out long ago,
          Cross my fingers, I don't know someone poked you down below.
          Can I Graduate,
          Can I get my punk-ass off the street,
          Can I look into the faces that I meet,
          I'm not waiting here for you to die,
          Will this song live on long after we do.</br></p>

    <p><br>When I'm away from you
          I'm happier than ever
          Wish I could explain it better
          I wish it wasn't true
          Give me a day or two
          To think of something clever
          To write myself a letter
          To tell me what to do
          Do you read my interviews?
          Or do you skip my avenue?
          When you said you were passing through
          Was I even on your way?</br>
          <br>I knew when I asked you to
          Be cool about what I was telling you
          You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
          And I'd end up more afraid
          Don't say it isn't fair
          You clearly weren't aware that you
          Made me miserable
          So if you really wanna know
          When I'm away from you
          I'm happier than ever
          Wish I could explain it better
          I wish it wasn't true
          You call me again, drunk in your Benz</br>
          </br>Driving home under the influence
          You scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
          'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends
          I don't relate to you
          I don't relate to you, no
          'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
          You made me hate this city
          And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
          Never told anyone anything bad
          'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
          And all that you did was make me fucking sad
          So don't waste the time I don't have
          And don't try to make me feel bad
          I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
          But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
          Never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
          Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
          You ruined everything good
          Always said you were misunderstood
          Made all my moments your own
          Just fucking leave me alone</br>

          Don't try to jail my thoughts and think pre-cents

          Don't have to see you to touch you
          This is what braille look like, it's on sight
          If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
          We know what Hell look like
          Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes
          [Kanye West:]
          Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
          Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
          Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
          God gon' post my bail tonight</br><p>
    <h3 id="eight">Solo Dolo - Kid Cudi</h3>
    <p><br>Listen good
          I don't have nobody
          But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
          Hoping what I hear, loops itself continuously
          Then I wont be afraid
          No no
          Oh whoa whoa whoa
          Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right
          Oh whoa whoa whoa
          Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
          I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
          Oh oh oh
          Oh oh
          Look at me
          You tell me
          Just what you see
          Am I, someone whom, you may love, or enemy
          Am I speakin' for, you and yours, or someone else
          I need some answers
          Yeah yeah
          Oh whoa whoa whoa</br>
          <br>Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right
          Oh whoa whoa whoa
          Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
          I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
          Oh oh oh
          Oh oh
          My world turns
          Flippin' the bird
          To the ones who figure, me
          Outcast no not the duo
          Back in Shaker heights
          When they knew who
          Though little brother was a strange one
          Boo hoo
          Cry me a river hater
          Look who traveled out an igloo
          Cold cold world wasn't fit for me at, all
          Look at where I stand at</br>
          <br>Tall, Cutcha' my Kid Cudi bisohs
          Mute muthafucka' back home
          Quick pause
          Gargle on my mayo
          Look at me I bet I'm the one you think to fail
          Floatin' in my mind
          No sail
          Ahoy
          Ahoy
          Listen Good
          I don't need nobody
          This is what you feel are the sounds of insanity
          Hopin' what I hear loops itself to finish me
          No I wont be afraid
          Hey hey
          Oh whoa whoa whoa
          Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right
          Oh whoa whoa whoa
          Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
          I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
          Why must it feel so right when I know that it's wrong,
          It's wrong
          When will I ever learn from the words in my songs
          I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo.</br></p>

          Let's work, hey
          Plottin' my escape, this game ridin'-ridin' faith
          Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
          Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
          I was doin' 80 on the interstate
          Tryna make it back before my class started
          Country n- never seen a passport
          'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
          Now I'm at the Gardens sittin' half court
          Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
          'Ville n- never seen nothin'
          'Cept a triple-triple bean jumpin'
          Good-good leave a fiend crumpin'
          Made it out, it gotta mean somethin'
          Either you gon' hustle hard
          A n- Uncle Sam got your a- re-enlisting
          Two-six, murder scene pumpin'</br>
          <br>Better leave it tucked, 'cause y'ain't dumpin'
          Pow, pow, n-, he slumpy
          12 comin', we ain't seen nothin'
          Time change, n- ain't rumblin' no more
          Nah, what for? Hungry for more
          If you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumblin'
          Bow-tie and I'm still munchin'
          Big bag, never fear fumblin'
          Want smoke? N- don't choke
          I'm a whole nico-nicotine company
          Dreamville the only, not a Navy
          How could you ever try to play me?
          Kill 'em on a song walk up out the booth
          Do the Westbrook rock-a-baby</br>
          <br>I never fall out with the bro
          Hate when your family turn into foe
          We had a penthouse on the road
          Interior decorated with the h-
          Just like a multiple-choice getting chose
          My n- like "Eenie, meenie, minee, moe"
          Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
          Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
          Out of the concrete was a rose and windows was cold</br>
          <br>Had to go over and stand by the stove
          We from the Southeast, n- know
          This where the opps creep real slow
          Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
          I punch the time sheet, not no more
          And now my assigned seat is a throne
          Plottin' my escape, this game ridin'-ridin' faith
